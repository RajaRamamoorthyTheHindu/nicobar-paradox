## 🎮 Game Mechanics Deep Dive

### Core Gameplay Loop

The Great Nicobar Paradox game is a turn-based decision-making simulation where players take on the role of a project manager overseeing the ₹81,800 crore development project. Each turn represents a significant phase of the project timeline.

### Resource Management

#### Budget System
- **Starting Budget**: ₹81,800 crores (based on real project allocation)
- **Budget Depletion**: Each decision costs money, reflecting real-world project expenses
- **Budget Tracking**: Real-time display of remaining funds
- **Bankruptcy Condition**: Game ends if budget reaches zero

#### Three-Pillar Metric System

**Social Impact (Purple Bar)**
- Represents community welfare, indigenous rights, and public approval
- Affected by: Community engagement, relocation programs, cultural preservation
- High Social Impact: Happy communities, preserved traditions, local support
- Low Social Impact: Displaced communities, cultural loss, public protests

**Economic Growth (Yellow Bar)**
- Represents job creation, infrastructure development, and economic benefits
- Affected by: Port construction, urban development, industrial projects
- High Economic Growth: Job opportunities, increased trade, regional prosperity
- Low Economic Growth: Limited opportunities, investor concerns, economic stagnation

**Environmental Health (Green Bar)**
- Represents ecosystem preservation, biodiversity, and ecological balance
- Affected by: Conservation measures, deforestation, marine protection
- High Environmental Health: Protected habitats, thriving wildlife, sustainable practices
- Low Environmental Health: Habitat destruction, species extinction, ecological collapse

### Decision Framework

#### Available Decisions

**1. Build Port Infrastructure**
- **Cost**: ₹15,000 crores
- **Effects**: Social -20, Economic +25, Ecology -30
- **Description**: Construct deep-water port and shipping facilities
- **Real-world Impact**: Major economic driver but devastating to marine ecosystems
- **Strategic Consideration**: High-cost, high-reward option with severe environmental consequences

**2. Implement Conservation Measures**
- **Cost**: ₹8,000 crores
- **Effects**: Social -15, Economic -25, Ecology +20
- **Description**: Establish protected areas and wildlife corridors
- **Real-world Impact**: Preserves biodiversity but slows development progress
- **Strategic Consideration**: Environmental investment that may frustrate stakeholders

**3. Expand Urban Development**
- **Cost**: ₹12,000 crores
- **Effects**: Social -25, Economic +30, Ecology -35
- **Description**: Build housing and commercial zones
- **Real-world Impact**: Creates infrastructure but consumes pristine forest land
- **Strategic Consideration**: Balanced cost with mixed social reception

**4. Focus on Social Programs**
- **Cost**: ₹5,000 crores
- **Effects**: Social +20, Economic -20, Ecology -15
- **Description**: Invest in community welfare and relocation support
- **Real-world Impact**: Improves community relations but delays project timelines
- **Strategic Consideration**: Lowest cost option for maintaining social stability

### Victory and Defeat Conditions

#### Victory Requirements (All must be met)
1. **Metric Threshold**: All three metrics (Social, Economic, Environmental) must remain above 50%
2. **Turn Completion**: Successfully complete all 10 turns
3. **Budget Management**: Maintain positive budget balance
4. **Balanced Approach**: Demonstrate sustainable development practices

#### Defeat Scenarios
1. **Social Collapse** (Social ≤ 30%): Communities revolt, project faces massive opposition
2. **Ecological Collapse** (Ecology ≤ 30%): Environmental destruction triggers legal challenges
3. **Economic Collapse** (Economic ≤ 30%): Investors withdraw, project becomes unviable
4. **Budget Depletion** (Budget ≤ 0): Financial resources exhausted, project halted
5. **Time Expiration**: Failed to maintain balance across all 10 turns

### Strategic Gameplay Elements

#### Decision Timing
- **Early Game**: Focus on establishing foundation while maintaining balance
- **Mid Game**: Navigate increasing complexity and competing demands
- **Late Game**: Manage consequences of earlier decisions while staying within budget

#### Risk vs. Reward Analysis
- **High-Cost Decisions**: Offer greater impact but limit future options
- **Balanced Decisions**: Moderate effects across multiple metrics
- **Emergency Decisions**: React to critical metric drops

#### Notification System
- **Real-time Feedback**: Immediate consequences of each decision
- **Contextual Messages**: Explain the real-world implications
- **Progress Tracking**: Visual indicators of metric changes
